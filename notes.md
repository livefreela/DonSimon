Meanwhile, if you want to get rid of the Cross Origin errors in the console, you'll need to run a local HTTP server from your project's directory and load the circles.html file from there. The steps are as follows:

*Note: if using Windows, see instructions here

1) navigate to your project folder in the terminal

2) run: 

python -m SimpleHTTPServer
3) open up your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000

4) select the index.html file
