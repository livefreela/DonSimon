###Getting Started: Installation instructions:

DonSimon can be played via a touchscreen/mouse, but playing Simon is all about mashing buttons!  Fortunately for us, most users will have a bunch of great buttons right in front of them - aka the keyboard.  Accordingly, keys "T", "Y", "G" and "H" map to the pads in the game.  (Look at the keys, it makes sense).

Era toggles on the screen's left switch between 3 "eras" of Buchla synthesis:
- 1963 -  colorful sine wave based, frequency-modulated sounds of the Buchla 100.  Bongos!  
- 1973 - featurning the complex waveshaping of the greatest analog oscillator there ever was, and likely will ever be, the holy grail: the Buchla 259
- 2004 - Buchla goes digial.  Wavetables, aliasing, crispy bit-wise weirdness.  Good Times.

"Difficulty" toggle works two ways.  In easy mode, Simon increments by one move per turn, in difficult it increments by two.  In difficult mode, timers for flash duration and user count-out are also faster.

For your game, this section will include the link to your hosted game's site.
